 Project Overview
The collection is organized into three distinct parts, each focusing on different logical or mathematical challenges.

 A
Filename: cat part a.exe

Description: An executable representing the first component of the project series.

 B
Source File: cat part b.cpp

Executable: cat part b.exe

Functionality: This component implements specific algorithmic logic designed to handle data processing or mathematical operations.

 C
Source File: cat Part c.cpp

Executable: cat Part c.exe

Functionality: The final part of the series, providing advanced logic and concluding the sample project set.

 Prerequisites
To run the source code, you will need:

Compiler: A C++ compiler such as g++ (MinGW/GCC) or the MSVC compiler.

Environment: A terminal or IDE (VS Code, Code::Blocks, or Visual Studio).

How to Run
Using Executables
Simply run the .exe files directly from your terminal or file explorer (Windows environment):

Bash

 Example
"./cat part b.exe"
Compiling from Source
If you wish to modify the code, compile the .cpp files using a C++ compiler:

Bash

# Example for Part B
g++ "cat part b.cpp" -o cat_part_b
./cat_part_b
Pharmacy System
A modern, high-performance console application designed for pharmacy management, built on the latest .NET ecosystem.

Technical Specifications
This project is built using the following technical stack and configurations:

Target Framework: .NET 8.0 (LTS)

Output Type: Executable (.exe)

Implicit Usings: Enabled (Reduces boilerplate code by globally including common namespaces)

Nullable Reference Types: Enabled (Promotes code safety by preventing null reference exceptions at compile-time)

 Key Features
Lightweight Architecture: Optimized for speed and minimal resource consumption.

Modern C# Standards: Leverages the latest language features provided by .NET 8.

Centralized Configuration: Managed via a structured .csproj file for easy dependency handling.

 Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Pharmacy-System.git
cd Pharmacy-System
Restore Dependencies:

Bash

dotnet restore
Build the Project:

Bash

dotnet build
Run the Application:

Bash

dotnet run
 Usage
This system is designed to provide a command-line interface (CLI) for:

Managing medication inventory.

Tracking prescriptions.

Processing pharmaceutical transactions

CSS Solar System Animation
A sleek, lightweight animation of the inner solar system built using HTML and CSS. This project visualizes the orbital paths of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars around the Sun.

 Features
Orbital Mechanics: Uses CSS animations to simulate the rotation of planets around a central star.

Inner Planets: Includes dedicated layers for:

☿ Mercury (Orbit 1)

♀ Venus (Orbit 2)

⊕ Earth (Orbit 3)

♂ Mars (Orbit 4)

Clean DOM Structure: Utilizes a nested "Orbit > Planet" hierarchy for easy styling and independent rotation speeds.

 Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure for the celestial bodies.

CSS3: (External file: mit.css) Handles positioning, keyframe animations, and spherical styling.

 File Structure
index.html: Contains the DIV structure for the Sun and planetary orbits.

mit.css: (Required) Should contain the animation logic and visual styles (colors, sizes, and rotation speeds).

 Setup & Usage
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/vigilant-44e/solar-system-animation.git
Ensure styles are linked: Make sure you have a file named mit.css in the same directory as your index.html.

Open the project: Simply open index.html in any modern web browser to view the animation.

 Customization
You can easily adjust the animation speed in your CSS by modifying the animation-duration property for each orbit:

Faster: Decrease the seconds (e.g., 5s).

Slower: Increase the seconds (e.g., 20s).

Executables: The provided .exe files are pre-compiled for Windows systems.

Modern C++: These files leverage standard C++ libraries to ensure efficiency and readability.
